# Multi Counter
Simply and quickly create, name, use and delete multiple click-counters, useful to count multiples of specific items within a total set of objects (e.g. models of cars out of a larger group of cars).

## To Do
- Add 2nd "Fit" option to fit counters to screen up to configured amount (e.g. if the amount of rows is 5, when there are 2, 3, 4 or 5 counters in the current row, they will be split evenly on screen, any more than that will be pushed onto a new row) to eliminate blank space 
- Sort counters by count or into alphabetical order (both by either ascending & decending)
- Keyboard shortcut to add/delete counter
- Keyboard shortcuts (numpad) to add 1 to corresponding counter
- Remove/minus from counter
- Reset counter
- Warning if 2 counters of same name are present (with option to combine?)
- Counter colour density (colour gets darker based on count)
- Randomly colour elements (limited to pastel css vars) on reload with optional button click to cycle through pastel colours
- Checkered-style alternating counter colours to differentiate counter edges
- Button to add count to all counters simultaneously
- Button to add count to currently-selected counters simultaneously
- Option to 'Lock' counters, preventing deletion, count/number change, name change etc.
- Print current counters to text file / copy text / .csv
- ~~Change amount of columns/rows on the fly~~
- ~~Add tick boxes to counters to allow counter deletion~~
- ~~Add "Fit" or "Auto" tickbox config to automatically fit all counters to screen (hides rows/columns input when enabled)~~
