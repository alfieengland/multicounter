# Multi Counter
Simply and quickly create and use multiple click-counters, useful to count multiples of specific items within a total set of objects (e.g. models of cars out of all cars in a car park).

## To Do
- Change amount of columns/rows on the fly
- Sort counters by count or into alphabetical order
- Keyboard shortcut to add counter
- Keyboard shortcuts (numpad) to add 1 to corresponding counter
- Remove/minus from counter
- Warning if 2 counters of same name are present (with option to combine?)
- Colour code (grey for 0 count, red for negative, green for highest, yellow for lowest etc)
- Fit counters to screen up to configured amount (e.g. if the amount of rows is 5, when there are 2, 3, 4 or 5 counters in the current row, they will be split evenly on screen, any more than that will be pushed onto a new row)
